# bug list

Every bug found, and the test that stops it coming back.

A bug is not finished when it is fixed. It is finished when a test exists that fails against
the old code. No entry goes in here without that test, and the test name is written down so
anyone can run it.

To check an entry is real, revert the fix, run the named test, and watch it fail.

|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Agent output went to a pipe nobody drained. Output was lost, and any agent writing past the roughly 64 KB pipe buffer blocked forever. | Running `aos run examples/hello.json` by hand. The echo printed nothing. | `a_chatty_agent_finishes_and_its_output_is_kept` and `agent_output_lands_in_its_log` |

## bug 1, in full

`Supervisor::start` spawned children with `Stdio::piped()` for stdout and stderr, then never
read either pipe. Two problems came from one mistake.

The visible one was that output vanished. The pipe was dropped when the child was reaped, so
an agent could run perfectly and leave no trace of what it said.

The serious one was the deadlock. A pipe holds about 64 KB on Linux. Once full, the next
write blocks. With nothing reading, a chatty agent stops there and never exits, and the
supervisor waits on it forever. This was found by luck, because `echo` writes 30 bytes.

Fix. Children now write to a per agent file under the run directory, opened for appending.
A file never fills, so there is nothing to drain and nothing to block on.

Guard. `a_chatty_agent_finishes_and_its_output_is_kept` runs `seq 1 200000`, about 1.3 MB,
which is twenty times the buffer. Against the piped version it hangs until its 20 second
deadline and fails. `agent_output_lands_in_its_log` checks the content is actually kept,
because a fix that stops the hang but still loses output is only half a fix.

Verified by reverting the fix and watching the test fail, then restoring it.
