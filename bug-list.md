# bug list

Every bug found, and the test that stops it coming back.

A bug is not finished when it is fixed. It is finished when a test exists that fails against
the old code. No entry goes in here without that test, and the test name is written down so
anyone can run it.

To check an entry is real, revert the fix, run the named test, and watch it fail.

| id | bug | found by | guard |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Agent output went to a pipe nobody drained. Output was lost, and any agent writing past the roughly 64 KB pipe buffer blocked forever. | Running `aos run examples/hello.json` by hand. The echo printed nothing. | `a_chatty_agent_finishes_and_its_output_is_kept` and `agent_output_lands_in_its_log` |
| 2 | The adoption test helper waited on `setsid` with no bound. `setsid` had not forked, so the sleeper was still our child and the wait blocked for the full 511 seconds. | `cargo test --test adoption` hitting a two minute timeout with no output. | `wait_bounded` in `tests/adoption.rs`, which panics with the reason after 5 seconds |

## bug 1, in full

`Supervisor::start` spawned children with `Stdio::piped()` for stdout and stderr, then never
read either pipe. Two problems came from one mistake.

The visible one was that output vanished. The pipe was dropped when the child was reaped, so
an agent could run perfectly and leave no trace of what it said.

The serious one was the deadlock. A pipe holds about 64 KB on Linux. Once full, the next
write blocks. With nothing reading, a chatty agent stops there and never exits, and the
supervisor waits on it forever. This was found by luck, because `echo` writes 30 bytes.

Fix. Children now write to a per agent file under the run directory, opened for appending.
A file never fills, so there is nothing to drain and nothing to block on.

Guard. `a_chatty_agent_finishes_and_its_output_is_kept` runs `seq 1 200000`, about 1.3 MB,
which is twenty times the buffer. Against the piped version it hangs until its 20 second
deadline and fails. `agent_output_lands_in_its_log` checks the content is actually kept,
because a fix that stops the hang but still loses output is only half a fix.

Verified by reverting the fix and watching the test fail, then restoring it.

## bug 2, in full

In test code rather than in the product, and worth recording anyway, because the trap is real
and the lesson is one this project already claims to have learned.

`make_orphan` needs a process that is genuinely not our child. It ran `setsid sleep 511` and
waited for `setsid` to exit, expecting to be left with an orphan.

`setsid` only forks when it is not already a process group leader. Otherwise it execs its
argument in place. The spawned `setsid` was not a group leader, so it became `sleep` itself,
and the wait sat there for the full 511 seconds. The test suite hit its timeout with no
output at all.

Two fixes, because there were two mistakes.

`setsid --fork` forces the fork, so the orphan is real. That is the correctness fix.

`wait_bounded` gives the wait a five second deadline and panics naming the cause. That is the
guard, and it is the more important half. The project already holds the rule that an
unbounded wait is a bug, in `signal::wait_bounded` and in the Windows AOS bug list before
that. The rule was written down and then broken in the next file, which is the honest lesson
here. A hang reports nothing. A bounded wait that fails tells you what went wrong.
